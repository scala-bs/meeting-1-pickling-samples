# Pickling Samples

This repository holds two pickling examples.


## Simple Example

The simple example is taken from the pickling repository. It can be run with the following command:

```bash
activator "run-main de.scala_bs.wille.pickling.sample.SimpleSample"
```


## Extended Example

The second example illustrates Pickle's _Unanticipated Evolution_ feature.
It introduces two new case classes and pickles them (no configuration or further coding needed!).
It can be run by typing:

```bash
activator "run-main de.scala_bs.wille.pickling.sample.ExtendedSample"
```
